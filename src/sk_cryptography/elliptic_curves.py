# Notes on Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
# =========================================================================================
# ECDH works the same way as traditional Diffie Hellman but relies on the difficulty of 
# the elliptic curve discrete log problem 
# 
# Public parameter:
# A prime number p used to define the finite field Fp
# An elliptic curve E over Fp defined by some equation of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod p)
# A base point G in E(Fp) with order n
# n must be a large prime
# 
# Key generation:
# Alice chooses a prive key, a, from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}
# Alice computes her public key: A = aG
# Bob chooses a private key, b, from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}
# Bob computes her public key B = bG
#
# Computing the shared secret:
# Alice computes S = aB = a(bG)
# Bob computes S = bA = b(aG)
# note that ab = ba since we're working over a field
#
# Deriving the key:
# The shared secret is S = (x,y)
#
# Security:
# It is considered classically infeasible to compute a given A and G

# Notes on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
# =========================================================================================
# ECDSA is the elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
# Itâ€™s used to sign messages (to prove authenticity and integrity) and for verification (to check that a signature is valid).
# Security is based on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem
# 
# Setup:
# A prime p used to define the finite field Fp
# An elliptic field E over Fp
# A base point G on E, G has order n
# n must be a large prime
# Private key: d, a random integer from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}
# Public key: Q = dG 
# 
# Signing a message:
# Suppose Alice is sending a message to Bob and she wants to sign it
# Alice and Bob will agree on a hash scheme ahead of time (SHA-256 for example)
# First, she will hash the message, e = H(m)
# Alice will select a random nonce k from the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} unique to that signature
# Alice computes the point (x1, y1) = kG
# Next she calculates r = x1 mod n (if r = 0, start over)
# Last compute s = k^{-1} (e + dr) (mod n) (if s = 0, start over)
# Her signature is the pair (r, s)
#
# Verifying a signature:
# Suppose Bob receives a message, m, from Alice with the signature (r,s)
# First, check that r and s are in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}
# Hash the message e = H(m)
# Compute the inverse w = s^{-1} (mod n)
# Compute u1 = ew (mod n), u2 = rw (mod n)
# Compute the elliptic curve point (x2, y2) = u1G + u2Q
# The signature is valid if r is congruent to x2 mod n
#
# Security:
# Given G and Q, it's classically intractable to compute dd
# (as long as the nonce isn't reusable or predictable)
